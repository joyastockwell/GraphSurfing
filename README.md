# GraphSurfing
Stores unweighted graphs using adjacency lists or matrix; finds strongly connected components and shortest paths.
Has lazy iterators for sucessors and predacessors of vertices. Supports addition and removal of edges after initialization of map. Finds in and out degrees of vertices when user wishes.
Written in Rose-Hulman's CSSE230: Data Structures and Algorithms. Skeleton provided by Nate Chenette. Developed strongly connected component and shortest path algorithms with Reid Witte.
